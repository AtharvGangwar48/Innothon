          {/* Step 1 */}
          <div>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">1. Blocks are like pages in the notebook:</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              When someone wants to record something (e.g., "John borrowed my toy car"), they write it down on a new page. This page is like a "block" of information.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 italic">This page isn't added to the notebook yet. It's just a proposed record.</p>
          </div>

          {/* Step 2 */}
          <div>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">2. The "Chain" is like linking pages together:</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Before a new page (block) can be added to everyone's notebooks, everyone needs to agree that it's a valid record.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Once everyone agrees, that page is sealed shut with a special "digital glue" (cryptography). This connects it to the previous page, creating an unbreakable chain.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 italic">If you try to change an old page, the digital glue breaks, and everyone knows you cheated!</p>
          </div>

          {/* Step 3 */}
          <div>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">3. Everyone has a copy (Decentralization):</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Because everyone has an identical copy of the entire chain, there's no single point of failure.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              If one copy gets corrupted, others will show the original, correct record.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Step 4 */}
          <div>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">4. It's permanent and transparent (Immutability):</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Once a page is added and "glued" into the chain, it can never be removed or changed.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              All transactions are transparent â€” everyone can see what's been recorded.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 italic">Imagine a never-ending chain of receipts, each linked to the previous one, traceable back to the start.</p>

          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Because it creates a system of trust without needing a middleman. We don't rely on a single bank or company to tell us what's true.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            The truth is collectively verified and stored by the network itself, making it:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
            <li>Transparent: Everyone can see the records (though identities can remain anonymous).</li>
            <li>Secure: Extremely difficult to hack or alter.</li>
            <li>Efficient: Transactions can be faster and cheaper by cutting out intermediaries.</li>
          </ul>

            <li><strong>Tracking your food:</strong> Know exactly where your vegetables came from, ensuring freshness and safety.</li>

            <li><strong>Secure medical records:</strong> Give patients control over their health data, accessible securely.</li>

            Blockchain isn't just a tech trend; it's a fundamental shift in managing and sharing information with trust and transparency. Its potential to reshape industries is immense.

            So, next time you hear "blockchain," think of it as a super-secure, shared digital record book that's making the world more transparent, one linked "page" at a time.
